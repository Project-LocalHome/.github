# Project LocalHome

One software developer's plan to make open source, local-first, home automation a realistic option.

It's not ready for use yet. If you're interested in helping to create it, get in touch at [steven@eddies.me.uk](mailto:steven@eddies.me.uk).


## The Goal

Anyone could just buy a hardware box, plug it in, point a browser at it, and have a working home automation server. Or they could freely install it on (say) their own Raspberry Pi in a few clicks instead.

It would support lighting, heating, energy monitoring and security monitoring. Other features would be added if there's demand.


## Design Principles

1. **Local first**: it shouldn't rely on a cloud server or internet connection for its standard features. Cloud services can add extra functionality where it's not feasible to implement locally.
2. **Easy to use**: people shouldn't need to be techies to use it (nor to have lots of time on their hands).
3. **Reused**: it should build on the best open source software already available, rather than reinventing it.
4. **Safe and secure**: it should be fully secure by default, including security updates, backups etc.
5. **User controlled**: the user should keep control of their own data and the configuration of the system.
6. **Low energy**: it shouldn't use more than about 10W of electricity.
7. **Well integrated and extensible**: it should support common standards and products out of the box, and users should be able to add support for others.
